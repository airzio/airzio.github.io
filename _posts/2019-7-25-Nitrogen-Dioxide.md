Nitrogen Oxide ( $$NO$$ ) and Nitrogen Dioxide ( $$NO_2$$ ) are often referred as ( $$NO_x$$ ).
The most widely spread source of $$NO_x$$ pollution are car engines. Engine makers are obligated to implement $$NO_x$$ reduction design. In order to minimize $$NO_x$$ emission, it is important to keep engine tuned up to makers standards and use OEM parts for replacement during repair and overhauls.

The fossil-fueled household appliances used for cooking and heating are the other source of Nitrogen Dioxide.

$$NO_2$$ hits the respiratory system.  May cause illnesses or damage of lung and breathing passages.
When combined with water in the atmosphere, Nitrogen Dioxide forms Nitric acid and contributes to acid rains.

## Regulatory levels

- **U.S. EPA**
  - 0.05 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 1-year period*
- **OSHA**:
  - 5 ppm - *highest permissible concentration*
- **MAK**
  - 5 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 8-hours period*
  - 10 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 5-min period*

## Reference levels

- **NIOSH**:
  - 1 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 5-min period*
  - 200 ppm - *maximum exposure*
- **WHO**:
  - 0.02 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 1-rear period*
  - 0.1 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 1-hour period*
- **ACGIH**
  - 3 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 8-hours period*
  - 5 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 15-min period*
- **Canadian regulations**
  - 0.25 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 1-hour period*
  - 0.05 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 8-hours period*

There are dedicated Nitrogen Dioxide sensors available mostly for industrial use. Indoor Air Quality sensors are used for personal applications. Such sensors capable of sensing a wide range of pollutants. The downside of most of the air quality sensors is that they are unable to detect separate gas concentrations because they react on all pollutants at once and output cumulative reading in some air quality units. Nevertheless, it is recommended to install Air Quality Detectors in living and working premisses .
