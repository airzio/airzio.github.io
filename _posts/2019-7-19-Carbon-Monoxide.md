Carbon Monoxide ( $$CO$$ ) is extremely dangerous substance to human health and life. It originates from the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels and some chemical reactions.
No $$CO$$ should be detected in inhabited premisses at any time. Trapped in the blood flow, Carbon Monoxide reacts with blood hemoglobin. Hemoglobin which combined with $$CO$$ is unable to react with oxygen and transport it to the body cells.

Permissible levels of $$CO$$ in the indoor air is very low due to it's toxicity.

## Regulatory levels

### Regulations for industrial environments

- **OSHA**
  - **PEL** = 50 ppm (TWA) - *highest average concentration for any 8-hours period*
- **MAK**
  - 30 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 8-hours period*
  - 60 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 30-min period*
- **GOST 12.1.005-88 Occupational safety standards system. General sanitary requirements for working zone air**
  - 20 $$\mu g/m^3$$ - *highest permissible concentration*
  - 50 $$\mu g/m^3$$ - *highest permissible concentration for 1-hour exposure. Not less than 2 hours prior repetitive exposure*
  - 100 $$\mu g/m^3$$ - *highest permissible concentration for 30-minutes exposure. Not less than 2 hours prior repetitive exposure*
  - 200 $$\mu g/m^3$$ - *highest permissible concentration for 15-minutes exposure. Not less than 2 hours prior repetitive exposure*

### Outdoor air regulatory levels

- **U.S. EPA**
  - 9 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 8-hours period, not to be exceeded more than once a year*
  - 35 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 1-hour period, not to be exceeded more than once a year*

## Reference levels

### Reference levels for industrial environments

- **NIOSH**:
  - **REL** = 35 ppm - *a workplace exposure limit - *Time Weighted Average (TWA) for exposure of 8 hours/day, 40 hours/week, for a working lifetime*
  - 200 ppm - *maximum exposure*
- **ACGIH**
  - 25 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 8-hours period*

### General reference levels

- **ASHRAE**
  - 9 ppm - *8 hours exposure*

- **WHO**:
  - 90 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 15-min period*
  - 50 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 30-min period*
  - 25 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 1-hour period*
  - 10 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 8-hours period*

### Indoor residential reference levels

- **Canadian regulations**
  - 25 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 1-hour period*
  - 11 ppm - *highest average concentration for any 8-hours period*

Carbon Monoxide detectors available on market as separate units. It is highly advised to install such detectors in premisses with appliances which combusting fossil fuels or adjacent to such premisses.
