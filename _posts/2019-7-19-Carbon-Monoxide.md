Carbon Monoxide ( $$CO$$ ) is extremely dangerous substance to human health and life. It originates from the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels and some chemical reactions.
No $$CO$$ should be detected in inhabited premisses at any time. Trapped in the blood flow, Carbon Monoxide reacts with blood hemoglobin. Hemoglobin which combined with $$CO$$ is unable to react with oxygen and transport it to the body cells.

Permissible levels of $$CO$$ in the indoor air is very low due to it's toxicity.

- **NIOSH** recommends:
  - **PEL** = of 35 ppm - a workplace exposure limit - *Time Weighted Average (TWA) for exposure of 8 hours/day, 40 hours/week, for a working lifetime*
- **U.S. EPA** recommends:
  - outdoor maximum level of 35 ppm (1 hour average)
  - outdoor maximum level 9 ppm (8 hour averaging)
- **OSHA** recommends: 
  - **PEL** =  50 ppm (TWA)
- **WHO** limits to:
  - 90 ppm (15 minute exposure)
  - 10 ppm (8 hour exposure)

Carbon Monoxide detectors available on market as separate units. It is highly advised to install such detectors in premisses with appliances which combusting fossil fuels or adjacent to such premisses.
