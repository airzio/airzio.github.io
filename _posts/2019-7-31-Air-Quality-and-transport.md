The problem of Air Quality and transport is complex and can be viewed from two perspectives:

- **Influence of the transport on the ambient air quality**
Any existing vehicle has a direct or indirect operational footprint of one of three types: carbon, nuclear or heat. It is obvious for cars, planes or ships powered by internal combustion engines. It is not so clear for "green" electric vehicles, but they are charged by the electricity of mostly fossil or nuclear origin.
- **Quality of the air inside the vehicle**
The internal air in most of the vehicles, except submarines and space ships, is mixed with external ambient air in some proportion. The quality of vehicle internal air depend on the ambient air quality, internal sources of pollution, air exchange rate, air refresh rate, available means of air filtration and regeneration.
