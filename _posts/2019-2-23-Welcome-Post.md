As defined by [Collins dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/air-quality), Air quality is the degree to which air is suitable or clean enough for humans, animals, or plants to remain healthy.  
Nowadays, the naturally pure air has become luxury privilege not everyone can get. Actually, with booming industry, resource and fossil fuels consumption, no one can breath anymore the air of the same purity as our ancestors could over centuries, at least, not without air filtration or regeneration of some kind. The global atmospheric level of Carbon Dioxide was exceeded 300 ppm in not so distant past, in 1950-s. In less than 70 years, in January 2019 mankind had managed to increase it up to 400 ppm. Although, this is still well below 1000 ppm which is maximum level for continuous exposure recommended by U.S. EPA and ASHRAE, with increased CO<sub>2</sub> level of ambient air higher air change rate is required to maintain its quality.  
Carbon Dioxide is only one of many air pollutants, such as Nitrogens Oxides, Carbon monoxide, Sulfur oxides, Particulate matter, Volatile organic compounds, various chemical gases and others.
