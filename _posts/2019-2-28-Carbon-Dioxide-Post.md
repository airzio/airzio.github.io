Carbon Dioxide is not actually taken seriously as a pollutant. You cant distinguish between ambient $$CO_2$$ concentration of 413 ppm ( check [CO2.earth](https://www.co2.earth/] it's pretty scary ) from let's say 1000 ppm concentration. However, concentrations above 2000 ppm, which often can be experienced in premisses with poor ventilation, may reduce the mental and perception abilities despite still cant be notice contiosly. Drowsiness and headaches start from 10000 ppm - 12000 ppm. Breathing difficuties begin when Carbone Dioxide concentration reaches 20000 ppm (2%)  $$CO_2$$ concentration of 30000 ppm (3%) doubles the breath rate.  

Various organizations state standards for $$CO_2$$ concentrations if the indoor air.

- **ASHRAE** recommends the maximum $$CO_2$$ concentration of 1000 ppm in its standard 62-1989
- **NIOSH** recommends:
  - **TLV** = 10,000 ppm (1%) - *maximum concentration of substance for 10-hr work shift at the workplace*
  - **PEL** = 30,000 ppm (3%) - *highest concentration for any 15-minute period*
  - **IDHL** = 40000 ppm (4%) - *Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health*
- **U.S. EPA** recommends the maximum of 1000 ppm for continuous exposure
- **OSHA** recommends:
  - **PEL** = 10,000 ppm (1%)
  - **STEL** = 30,000 ppm (3%)
