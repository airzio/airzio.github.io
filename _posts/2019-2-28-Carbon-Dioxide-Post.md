Carbon Dioxide is not actually taken seriously as a pollutant. You cant distinguish between ambient $$CO_2$$ concentration of 413 ppm ( check [CO2.earth](https://www.co2.earth/] it's pretty scary ) from let's say 1000 ppm concentration. However, concentrations above 2000 ppm, which often can be experienced in premisses with poor ventilation, may reduce the mental and perception abilities. $$CO_2$$ concentration of 30000 ppm (3%) doubles the breath rate.
